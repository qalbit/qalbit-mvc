            'answer'   => 'React Native is a framework that lets you build mobile apps using React and JavaScript or TypeScript, with components that render to native UI elements on iOS and Android. Instead of maintaining separate native codebases for each platform, much of the code can be shared, while still integrating with native modules when required.',

            'answer'   => 'React Native is a good fit when you need to support both iOS and Android, want to reuse React/TypeScript skills and your app does not rely heavily on platform-specific UI or very low-level device features. It works well for SaaS companion apps, customer portals, internal tools and many marketplace and booking flows.',

            'question' => 'How does React Native compare with Flutter or fully native development?',
            'answer'   => 'React Native, Flutter and native each have trade-offs. React Native is strong when you already use React/TypeScript and want closer alignment with your web stack. Flutter offers a very consistent UI layer and strong performance in many cases. Fully native Android/iOS is best when you need deep platform integrations or highly polished platform-specific UI. During discovery we help you decide which option fits your product and team best.',

            'answer'   => 'A Product Scaling Team is the right fit when you already have a working product or MVP in the market and you need to ship features faster, improve performance and stability, or prepare for the next stage of growth. Typical triggers include frequent production incidents, a growing backlog your internal team cannot keep up with, or pressure from customers and sales for new capabilities.',

            'answer'   => 'We usually begin with a structured technical audit: codebase review, architecture and infra assessment, monitoring and incident history. Based on that, we classify debt into high-risk issues that must be addressed quickly and lower-risk refactors that can be scheduled over time. Our goal is to stabilise the product while creating room for new features, not to rewrite everything from scratch unless absolutely necessary.',

We start with a short discovery and audit, then define a prioritised roadmap covering stability work, performance improvements, UX fixes and new features.
